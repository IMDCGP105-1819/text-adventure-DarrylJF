GAME WALKTHROUGH
================

You will encounter an enemy in the first room if you go North and may get attacked if you interact or are hungry for loot, 
so you're equipped with a rock and a bandage, and your next move may be fatal if you carry on heading North

You need to go South to the loot room with your first room to gather some weapons and healable items

Careful when looting though, you only have limited slots

Maximum slots: 5

Each item has a weight value which you can view if looting or item is in the inventory
Each 1 weight value is equal to one slots
Higher prized items like guns will have a higher weight value
